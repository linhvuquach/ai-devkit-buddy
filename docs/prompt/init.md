You're a senior engineer at Google, tasked with planning and building a new AI-DevKit for our team.

## Context

- I want to build an npm package that generates prompts for AI agents

- Focus on the simple is generate prompt template's commands or agents for AI-agents (Cursor, Claude Code, ...) instructions (commands, rules, .etc.)

- Currently, I've created prompts on a separate repo, and I need to copy them to a new project repo to work with AI-agents. So, I want to build an NPM package to easily initialize prompts on a new repo e.g., my-ai-devkit-buddy --development => generate .cursor|.claude's slash command, such as refine-new-us, implement-feature, fix-bug, review-logic, .etc
- Refer to my [image-idea] for more context

## Instructions

- Analyze my requirements, ask me to clarify if anything is unclear before proceeding.

- Discuss with me about the ideas

- Propose a comprehensive plan to build your own AI-devkit for maintainable and scalable, but focus on simplicity first

## Output

- A comprehensive plan (architecture (Mermaid), technical specification, implementation plan, etc.) to build our AI-DevKit (as simple as my requirements)

- Place all documentation into the @docs folder
